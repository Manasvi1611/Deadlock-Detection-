# Deadlock-Detection-
Deadlock is a situation where processes want to access resource held by other process which in turn is waiting for some other resource resulting in whole system to halt. In distributed environment this situation becomes more complicated since processes may exist in different locations. In distributed system all resources and information are distributed over various machines which makes deadlock handling difficult. In this paper we are implementing edge chasing deadlock handling technique for distributed system to handle deadlocks effectively.
